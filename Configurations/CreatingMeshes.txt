The tool is designed to work with meshes generated by makehuman, http://www.makehumancommunity.org/, (1.1, 1.0) representing human's geometry.

Generating a new mesh would involve the following steps

1. Create a model geometry using makehuman interface
2. Create a nude human, eye's and teeth should be added. The teeth location is used to determine face from back of the head
3. Select the CMU mb motion capture rig (Under Pose/Animate tab), this is essential for assigning body polygroups
4. Export the mesh as a Collada (dae) file
5. Import the mesh in Blender
6. Export the mesh from Blender as a obj file. Ensure that 'Polygroups', 'Write Normals', 'Write Materials' options are selected. 

For generating clothing model,

Design a human with clothing in makehuman and export it as a obj file. 
Note that, the route through blender is not required as polygroup information is not used.
However, to remove the human geometry the route should be followed and human geometry should be removed.
